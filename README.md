# MUI Dash

**Hi there!**

I created a dashboard by using Material UI with Reactjs. I learned a lot from version 4 to 5. I used almost all the common components in this project.

**Pages**

1. Dashboard
2. User
3. Product
4. Blog
5. Login
6. Register
7. 404

## Styling

For styling I mainly used `styled` function from `@material-ui/styles`.

I used the `sx` property when it was available in some certain components.

## Help Center

There's a big problem in the routing. I used `"react-router-dom": "^5.2.0"`. I couldn't nest the **Login** and **Register** component in the **AuthLayout** component. I tried the methods from version 6 but it didn't work.

I tried another way which can be found in the **routes.js** file. It didn't work as well.

If you can suggest me any way, I'll appreciate it very much.
